Hosting a major sporting event enhances team performance through the Home Advantage Effect—driven by familiar conditions, crowd support, and increased investment—while also boosting short-term economic growth through tourism, infrastructure investment, and job creation. However, the long-term economic impact may be negative due to rising debt, underutilized infrastructure, and financial strain. 

A country hosting the Olympics is no ordinary event because it can happen once in 100 years. It is an opportunity like no other for cities to shine and showcase the best out of the country to the rest of the world. Often, it boosts a country's overall mood and confidence, and home athletes have further motivation to be successful in front of their home crowds. The Olympics attract a lot of attention, and it needs to be perfect. Efforts are put in place which require significant financial investments. Host nations often increase funding for sports infrastructure, training programs, and athlete development in the years leading up to the event. This substantial government investment, often running into billions of dollars, impacts not just sports but also the broader economy. Understanding these financial dynamics provides a deeper insight into whether the economic benefits of hosting such events justify the costs. It raises an important question: how does hosting a major sporting event impact a country’s team performance and economic performance? Hosting a major sporting event significantly improves a country's team performance through increased investment in athlete development and facilities while boosting short-term economic growth by driving tourism, infrastructure investment, and job creation. On the other hand, its long-term economic impact remains uncertain, as benefits may be offset by rising public debt, underutilized infrastructure, and financial strain.
